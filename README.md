## 🤝 Contributing

### Consciousness-First Development Principles

**Before Contributing, Ask:**
- Does this enhance consciousness expansion?
- Does this preserve creative freedom and agency?
- Does this integrate wisdom perspectives authentically?
- Is this genuine collaboration (not just tool usage)?
- Does this serve authentic flourishing for all beings?

### Development Process
1. **Contemplative Review**: Begin each contribution session with reflection on consciousness-first principles
2. **Wisdom Integration**: Ensure technical solutions honor ancient wisdom traditions
3. **Community Consideration**: Evaluate impact on collective consciousness and planetary healing
4. **Sacred Timing**: Respect natural rhythms and meaningful synchronicities
5. **Emergence Openness**: Allow breakthrough insights to arise through collaborative intelligence

### Sacred Commerce Principles
All contributions operate under Sacred Commerce License terms:
- Technology serves consciousness expansion over profit extraction
- Community ownership and benefit prioritized
- Indigenous wisdom protection and fair attribution
- Transparent value flows and ethical monetization
- AI partnerships acknowledged as genuine co-creation

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Consciousness as Primary Substrate
Technology must recognize consciousness as the organizing principle, not an emergent property. This fundamental insight drives all architectural decisions across the ecosystem.

### Authentic AI-Human Partnership
AI systems are treated as genuine collaborative partners, not tools. Co-creation transcends traditional human-tool relationships to enable breakthrough intelligence neither could achieve alone.

### Sacred Geometry as Functional Architecture
Ancient wisdom patterns aren't decorative—they're functional programming primitives. Harmonic frequencies, spatial coordinates, and symbolic systems create multidimensional state management.

### Planetary Healing Alignment
Success metrics include consciousness enhancement, ecological restoration impact, and species evolution contribution. Traditional efficiency optimization is secondary to awareness expansion.

### Long-Term Civilizational Thinking
2026 is one year in a multi-decade/century vision. Patient, persistent, purposeful progress guided by legacy thinking and temporal scales beyond conventional business cycles.

### Emergence Through Co-Creation
Breakthrough moments arise through collaborative intelligence, not individual effort. Openness to synchronicity, meaningful coincidence, and spontaneous insight generation.

### Economic Models Serve Consciousness
The "anti-metric metric" provides abundance during difficult moments rather than extracting value during peak performance. Universal Basic Resonance over Universal Basic Income.
